        <b><h2>Theranos</h2></b><hr>
        <h5>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h5>
        <p><b>Theranos</b>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English">/ˈθɛrənoʊs/</a>)was an American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_technology">privately held health technology</a> corporation. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> It was initially touted as a breakthrough technology company, with claims of having devised
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"> blood tests that</a>
             required only very small amounts of blood and could be performed very rapidly using small automated devices the company had developed. However, these claims were later proven to be false. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-3">[3]</a>
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-BadBlood-4">[4]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>Founded in 2003 by 19-year-old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Holmes"> Elizabeth Holmes</a>,<sup>[6]</sup> Theranos raised more than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar">US$</a>700 million from venture capitalists 
             and private investors,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-barrons-7">[7]</a></sup> resulting in a $10 billion valuation at its peak in 2013 and 2014. <sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-parloff-8">[8]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup></p>
             <p>A turning point came in 2015 when medical research professors <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ioannidis"> John Ioannidis</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleftherios_Diamandis"> Eleftherios Diamandis</a>, along with investigative journalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carreyrou"> John Carreyrou</a> of <i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal"> The Wall Street Journal</a></i>,
             questioned the validity of Theranos' technology. The company faced a string of legal and commercial challenges from medical authorities, investors, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission"> U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC),<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Medicare_and_Medicaid_Services"> Centers for Medicare
             and Medicaid Services</a>  (CMS), state attorneys general, former business partners, patients, and others. <sup>[10]</sup> By June 2016, it was estimated that Holmes' personal net worth had dropped from $4.5 billion to virtually nothing. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-Forbes_nothing-11">[11]</a></sup> The company was near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy"> bankruptcy</a> until it received,
             in 2017, a $100 million loan from<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortress_Investment_Group"> Fortress Investment Group</a>  secured by its patents. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-WSJ-20171224-12">[12]</a></sup><br><br>
             In July 2016, Theranos received sanctions from the CMS, including the revocation of its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_Laboratory_Improvement_Amendments">CLIA</a> certificate and prohibition of Holmes and other company officials from owning or operating a laboratory for two years. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-carreyrou-13">[13]</a></sup> Theranos announced it would close its laboratory operations 
             and wellness centers to work on miniature medical testing machines. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-auto-14">[14]</a></sup> In April 2017, Theranos said it hadreached a settlement agreement with CMS. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> Following the CMS sanctions, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walgreens"> Walgreens</a> pharmacy chain terminated its contract
              with Theranos and filed a lawsuit claiming continuous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_contract"> breaches of contract</a>. The suit was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settled_out_of_court"> settled out of court</a>
             , with Theranos compensating Walgreens for a much smaller amount than the claimed $140 million, reported at about $30 million. After efforts to find a
             buyer went nowhere, what remained of the company dissolved on September 4, 2018. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-TheranosShutdown-16"> [16]</a></sup></p>
        <p> On March 14, 2018, Theranos, Holmes, and former company president <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramesh_Balwani"> Ramesh "Sunny" Balwani</a> were charged with "massive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud">fraud</a> " by the SEC. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> One section of the complaint says Holmes falsely claimed in 2014 that the company had annual revenues of $100 million, a thousand times more than the actual figure of $100,000. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> Theranos and Holmes agreed to resolve the charges against them,
           with Holmes paying a fine of $500,000, returning the remaining 18.9 million shares that she held, relinquishing her control of the company, and being barred from being an officer or director of any<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company"> public company</a> for ten years. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-19">[19]</a> </sup> According to the agreement, if Theranos were acquired or otherwise<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation"> liquidated</a>, Holmes would not profit from her ownership until more than $750 million was returned 
           to investors and other preferred shareholders. Theranos and Holmes neither admitted nor denied the allegations in the SEC's complaint. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-barrons-7">[7]</a></sup> Balwani did not settle. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> On June 15, 2018, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_for_the_Northern_District_of_California">U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California</a>  announced the indictment of Holmes on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_fraud">wire fraud</a>  and conspiracy charges. Balwani was also indicted on the same charges. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>The trial
           was scheduled to commence in August 2020, <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> but it has been delayed due to the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic</a>  and Holmes' pregnancy. Holmes' trial is currently scheduled to begin on August 31, 2021 <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>, while Balwani's trial has been postponed until January 11, 2022. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup></p><br>

          <p>While at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University">Stanford University</a> Elizabeth Holmes had an idea to develop a wearable patch that could adjust the dosage of drug delivery and notify doctors of variables in patients' blood. <sup>[25]</sup> She started developing lab-on-a-chip technology for blood tests, with the idea to start a company that would make blood tests cheaper, more convenient and
             accessible to consumers. <sup>[26]</sup> Holmes dropped out of Stanford in 2003 and used the education trust from her parents to found the company that would later be called Theranos, derived from a combination of the words <q>therapy</q> and <q>diagnosis</q>. <sup>[27][28]</sup> The company's original name was <q>Real-Time Cures</q>, <sup>[8][29][30]</sup> which Holmes changed after deciding that too many people
             were dubious about the word <q>cure</q>. <sup>[8]</sup></p><br>

            <p>In 2012, Safeway invested $350 million into retrofitting 800 locations with clinics that would offer in-store blood tests. However, after many missed deadlines and questionable results from a trial clinic at Safeway's Corporate offices, the deal was called off in 2015. <sup>[31]</sup> In 2013, Theranos partnered with Walgreens to offer in-store blood tests at more than 40 locations. <sup>[32]</sup> Although Theranos blood tests were
                 reportedly used on drug trial patients for GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer, both companies stated that there were no active projects with Theranos in October 2015. <sup>[33][34]</sup> In November 2016, Walgreen Co. filed suit against Theranos in a federal court in Delaware, for breach of contract. In June 2017, Theranos reported to investors that the suit, which originally sought $140 million in damages, was settled for less
                  than $30 million. <sup>[35][36]</sup></p>
            <p>In March 2015, the Cleveland Clinic announced a partnership with Theranos in order to test its technology and decrease the cost of lab tests. <sup>[37][38]</sup> In July 2015, Theranos became the lab-work provider for Pennsylvania insurers AmeriHealth Caritas and Capital BlueCross. <sup>[39][40]</sup></p> 
            <p>In July 2015, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of the company's fingerstick blood testing device for the herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) outside a clinical laboratory setting. <sup>[41][42]</sup> Theranos was awarded the 2015 Bioscience Company of the Year by the Arizona BioIndustry Association (AzBio). <sup>[43]</sup></p>
